We built a Smart Contract based private donation system.

Using blockchain technology, we created a secure and functional donation system.  The key point of the system is that it ensures that the donation is used in accordance of the donor's wishes.  The blockchain and the smart contract interacts with donor, campaign and the supplier.

This was the tool that we used.

* Hyperledger Fabric
* Hyperledger Composer
* Hyperledger REST API
* NodeJS
* GatsbyJS
* React
* Material-UI

Here is a link to the system.
