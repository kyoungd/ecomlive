An open donation system is a system that is available to everyone.  it is geared toward the public and it has a less compelx smart contract.

We created a simple web client attached to a headless CMS system and the Blockchain to manage the spending.

The following is the list of tools we used.
* Hyperledger Fabric
* Hyperledger Composer
* Hyperledger REST API
* Node JS
* Strapi (headless CMS system)
* Strpie (credit card processing)
* React
